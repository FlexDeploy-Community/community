FlexDeploy Plugins can be created using Java. You can read about the required methods and requirements on our wiki page: https://flexagon.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FD60/pages/9856634917/FlexDeploy+Plugin+SDK.

The Plugin SDK java doc is online here: https://flexagon.com/plugin-sdk/6.0/

You will need to reference the sdk libraries, which are available for download. You can find them on the wiki, or in this folder.
